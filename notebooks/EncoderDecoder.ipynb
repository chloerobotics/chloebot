But the the data splits into 3 arrows before going into Multi-Head Attention, just like we use the `x2` three times in `x2_attn, x2_scores = self.attn(x2,x2,x2,mask)`. This signifies that we used the same sequence of vectors for the generation of `num_heads` number of query `q`, key `k` and  value `v` vectors. \n",

The line in the diagram that branches and goes around the Multi-Head Attention layer and into the \"Add & Norm\" module, is the residual. In english, it means that the input to the norm layer is the sum of x after it passes through the Multi-Head Attention with a copy of x that has not passed through the Multi-Head Attention.\n",
