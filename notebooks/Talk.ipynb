    "Lets assemble the Encoder and Decoder into the Transformer, like older sequence to sequence models, Transformers also encode the sentence into vector representations and pass those representations along to the decoder to generate the response/reply/output/translation/etc. The Encoder and Decoder we can use separately such as `model.encoder(arguments)`. The very last part of the transformer is the mapping of each vector in the decoder output to logits for each token in the output vocabulary `output = self.out(d_output)`. There are as many logits as there are tokens in the output vocabulary. In the conceptual diagram we pretend that each decoder output is represented with 4 dimensional vectors and the last linear layer maps this vector to the output vocabulary which is only 5 tokens including the end of sentence `<eos>` token. In a more realistic model, the decoder might output 512 dimensional vectors and the last linear layer maps this vector to the output vocabulary which is a few thousand tokens wide, including words, punctuation marks and the end of sentence, unknown etc tokens. The softmax later on will balance all these logits to sum to 1.0 so that you can treat this as a probability distribution over the vocabulary from which the agent will draw/sample its next word. \n",
