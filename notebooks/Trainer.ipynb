Think of a real mask, usually there will be two holes poked out for the eyes and one hole for the mouth, but otherwise the mask is meant to cover the rest of my face. The mask for the input listen tensor covers the padded elements. Seems tedious, but this is an artifact of the way wee need to prepare data to train efficiently.

In addition you see that instead of flow I wrote \"from\" twice becaue I didnt pay enough attention to what I had already written, This is called self attention. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the decoder writes each word in responce, one word at a time, the word it just produce and it's previous words are fed back into the decoder to get the next word so it can pay attention to what has already been written. \n",

    "During training, we judge it based on whether it produced the right word or not, if it does not, we insert the right word at each position and hope that the next position is better predicted. This is called teacher forcing. during training, it can only pay attention to words in previous earlier positions, thus, even though we have the entire correct sequence given to us with each training batch, we will hide the words in later positions through the mask to simulate real self attention (you cant pay self attention to words you havent said yet). In addition to suppressing/covering the pad tokens, the reply mask also covers sequence positions in the future. \n",

At the next time step you can pay attention to both `<sos>` and also the first correct token, thus the mask will have the first two positions as True and the rest False `True, True, False . . . False`"

    "## Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "upervised Learning is the kind of learning that started the AI renaissance of the 2010s, but it is widely agreed by experts that it is not the type of learning that will get us to human level AI, at least not by itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "suppose the correct reply to listen = `bye`  `chloe` is reply = `see`  `ya` `<eos>`\n",
    "\n",
    "the batch we get gives is listen = `bye`  `chloe` and reply = `<sos>` `see`  `ya` `<eos>`\n",
    "\n",
    "we input `bye`  `chloe` into chloe, give her `<sos>` `see`  `ya`, plus the masks to prevent peaking into the future, and we compare whatever she replies against `see`  `ya` `<eos>`. I have been referring to `see`  `ya` `<eos>` as the \"correct response\", but this is also called the \"target\" abbreviated trg. In addition, what I have been referring to as \"listen\" is also called the \"source\" abbreviated src. \n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of training, in which we repeatedly challenge chloe by giving her an input sentence (listen tensor), see what she reponds (`chloes_reply`), compare `chloes_reply` to the right answer `reply`, aka \"the target\", then modify chloe's weights and biases (her synaptic connections) in order to get her closer to matching her `chloes_reply` to `reply`, aka \"the target\", is called supervised learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "When I say \"compare\" `chloes_reply` to the right answer `reply`, what do i mean? I mean that we have to give her a grade, or a numerical score, that tells us how well she is doing, then once we know that number we can change chloe \n",
    "in such a way that increases or decreases the numerical score. In machine learning, we typically choose to tie improvement to lower scores rather than in school where we tie better performance to higher scores. One way to rationalize this to yourself is that in supervised learning, there is one correct answer, and if you get that correct answer, your score is zero, there is no extra credit or creativity points here, just more and more punishment the further you are away from correct answer, what a terrible class right? \n",
    "\n",
    "This numerical score is the Loss, and the algorithm used to \"compare\" `chloes_reply` to the right answer `reply` and generate that score is the loss function. The way that we change chloe to make her get a better Loss is using one of the gradient decent optimizers such as the Adam Optimizer we mentioned in the intro START HERE, we we go more into this in the Learning Dynamics section. If you dont know, gradient decent algorithm are fancier version of the same concept: if you weight of synaptic connection has strength `W`, your input is `x`, your algorithm is `Wx`, the target is `y` and your loss function is `Loss = (y - Wx)^2`, then the derivative of the loss with respect to W `dL/dW` tells you whether to increase or decrease W in order to increase or decrease Loss. The derivative is also known as gradient when `W` is not one number but several numbers. So changing chloe's `W` is how we get her to say what we want. We will explain where `W` is in chloe's neural network in the Elements section. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Loss function\n",
    "\n",
    "The Loss function is a scalar, calculated from the output of your neural network and the ground truth labels, that requires the neural network to do what you want it to do in order to be minimized. This means if you change your parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient with respect to the loss, the neural network gets better at classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common loss function is the Cross Entropy Loss function, I have written a simplified version for you here\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Cross Entropy(chloes reply, target) = [i == target] \\cdot - ln(chloes reply_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me explain this with a toy example. Suppose chloe only has 2 tokens in her vocabulary, `'cat': 0, 'french': 1` and the correct answer to input source \"what is chloe?\" is the output target \"french cat\", the target in token indices is therefore `[1, 0]`. Supposed your chloe model has never been trained before, so her output is `[0.0, 0.0]` for the first token and `[0.0, 0.0]` for the second token, meaning, she has no idea what to say. Run the cell below to see what loss score chloe will get for this \"unsure\" response."
