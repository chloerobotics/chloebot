For now, just know the learning rate `opt.lr` is a hyperparameter whose initial value we choose, it modifies the magnitude of the step the Adam optimizer algorithm will take to update the weights, aka parameters, of the neural network model during training. As training progresses the learning rate is also changing according to a scheduler [cosine annealing schedule](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/issues/1642). `epochs` is the number of times we will cycle through the data during training. If you trained on the same dataset in a different sitting and would like to reload that trained model instead of training from scratch, simply paste this line of code below `model.load_state_dict(torch.load(opt.save_path))` before running it.
